I am an NSCC student at the eCampus in IT programming. In my first year, I took a data fundamentals course that focused on SQL syntax, ERD diagrams, normalization and other foundational concepts. In addition to my studies, I have done a significant amount of self-study work with PostgreSQL, SQLite and MongoDB. I have created web app and chat bot frontends for both relational and noSQL databases. 

An excellent example of my understanding of database management is my \textcolor{blue}{\href{https://alembichead.com/encounter-builder}{Encounter Builder}} (\textcolor{blue}{\href{https://github.com/Naokotani/encounter-builder}{git repository}}) that I built this year. This complex multi-step project required that I learn to effectively program in Rust and with the Svelte front-end; build  a web scraper to extract data from an open source document to build a database; create a PostgreSQL server, including the creation of tables and the management of users; create Rust and Sveltekit websevers; configure Nginx as a reverse proxy and many other tasks. This project is an excellent showcase of my ability to multitask. Not only did I have to work effectively in two programming languages, HTML/CSS, three web servers and with a relational database, but I did all of this in addition to my NSCC studies for which I have achieved excellent grades. 

My bachelor of arts degree in cultural anthropology makes me perfectly suited to the task of inviting various view points and itemizing user requirements. Understanding and documenting views and needs of others is essential to ethnography; a topic that I studied in significant detail. My degree required that that I do extensive writing and research for essays, a skill that I furthered honed during my time studying editing at George Brown College. My studies also necessitated extensive use of and familiarity with MS Office applications.

I have worked as an English teacher both in Canada and abroad. I am an effective communicator and comfortable teaching and speaking to groups of people. I have experience in teaching technical subjects as I have been tutoring a fellow NSCC student for several months. A further demonstration of my ability to clearly  communicate about technical  subjects is my \textcolor{blue}{\href{https://chris-hughes.dev/}{developer blog}} where I talk about the various self-study projects I am working on. 

My blend of technical and communication skills makes me an excellent candidate for this position. Additionally, my commitment to self-study in the field of database management shows that I have a passion for the subject, and I would welcome the opportunity to apply my unique skill-set to the position.
